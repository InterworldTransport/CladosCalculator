		Clados Testing Plan

The application is in a maintenance mode at the moment.  Work is underway to
include a Dyad class, but it could be awhile before it is added to the source
tree.  There are still some fundamental choices to be made about how Dyads are
to be represented.

In the mean time, work will begin on a Monad Viewer utility.  With it a use
should be able to see how Monads and their methods work.  We will also use it to
debug a refactoring attempt to clean up the Monad's implementation.
