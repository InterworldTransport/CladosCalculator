The 0.8 version of the clados calculator is done.  I have a few 
improvements in the CVS already for the next version, but I want 
to work up the nyad class a bit more before tagging the code.

Starting to build up the Monad Viewer utility.  I've had some 
practice now writing crude applications, so I should be able to 
make a simple viewer with buttons or menu options that allow the 
user to construct many monads in the viewer and then act on them 
through the use of each method in each Monad.

This viewer will also be useful as a debugger for larger applications
where the developer might wish to graft it in instead of making
their own from scratch.

Switching over to the use of Ant for building this library.
I have also extracted all traces of clados source code from 
SailAway in order to separate the two projects.  I did this in
anticipation of other projects using this library and/or getting
help from others in enhancing it or maintaining it.

The rotation method needed fixing.  I found this while doing
unit testing on SailAway.

I've altered some of the names of the internal and external
members having to do with Blade Projection, Blade counting,
and related parts.  There was a difference between the 
standard terminology used in Geometric Algebra and the way
I was using it.  Rather than confuse everyone, I have
adjusted the package to match the standard.

This results in a minor change to the API.  Methods that 
used to be called Blade<something> are now called
Grade<something>.

I have also added more comments and clarified a few of 
the older ones.  There is still a lot of commenting work
to go to make this class readable to other geometric algebra
developers, let alone to users of the package who want 
to avoid having to understand internal details.
