		Clados Library Plan

		Library Architecture and
		Plans for the future

Maintenance of this material is going to be done within the various 
mind map documents found in the docs/misc directory.  For those who
want to follow the material, know that the files can be viewed from 
an open source application called FreeMind.  FreeMind is hosted at
SourceForge.net and easily installed.  Make the effort to learn it!
