	Clados Development Plan

This file, DEVELOPMENT-PLAN, contains the plan by which the
Clados development group will operate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Policies regarding the Clados source repository:

By discussing items on the clados mailing lists, authors agree to 
permit inclusion of their ideas and implementation of them under the
terms of the GNU Public License.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedure for dealing with people who want to be application planners:

People who have checkin access are welcome to discuss the overall
direction of the application on clados-plan.  If the list traffic 
becomes too large, we will move the discussion to a BBS or IRC.  It is intended
that developers that want a say in direction will be able to make their
voices heard.  If they can convince the maintainer and community of the 
worthiness of their ideas, those ideas will be incorporated into the 
application plan.
