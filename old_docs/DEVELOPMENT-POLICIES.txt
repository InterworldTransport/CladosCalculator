               Clados Development Policies

This file, DEVELOPMENT-POLICIES, contains the policies by which the
Clados development group operates.  Also see the HACKING file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Policies regarding the Clados source repository:

By checking items into the repository, developers agree to permit
distribution of such items under the terms of the GNU Public License
version 2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedure for dealing with people who want to be developers:

People who want checkin access are first requested to send
patches and have them reviewed by a developer.  If they submit some
good ones (preferably over a period of time, to demonstrate sustained
interest), then one of the developers can ask the Clados maintainer 
whether it is OK to make this person a developer (after first sending
the prospective developer a copy of this file and then having the 
prospective developer say they want to be a developer).  If there
are no objections, the person will be made a developer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Policy regarding checkout-only access:

Checkout-only access to the Clados repository is available to all,
on an anonymous basis.
The exact technical mechanisms by which it is available are not
covered by this policy.  Sourceforge handles it well enough for now.
