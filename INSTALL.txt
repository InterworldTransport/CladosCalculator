I created an 'install' target within the ANT buildfile.  At the moment it
creates jar files for clados and the API documentation and places them in the 
top directory for the project.

The clados.jar file is a library that may be placed where java libraries are
stored on your system.  Be sure to include it in your classpath statement to
ensure other applications know where to find it's contents.

The 'install' target still doesn't do anything, so I removed it. 
Just use the 'jar' target and then run the bat script. 
It should be enough to see how things work.

The clados.jar file is expected in the lib directory of the project. You can 
see this by looking at the single shell command in the bat file. The actual
calculator is within the jar file target and the manifest file takes care of 
ensuring java -jar knows what to do.
