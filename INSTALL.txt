I created an 'install' target within the ANT buildfile.  At the moment it
creates jar files for clados and the API documentation and places them in the 
top directory for the project.

The clados.jar file is a library that may be placed where java libraries are
stored on your system.  Be sure to include it in your classpath statement to
ensure other applications know where to find it's contents.

The 'install' target still doesn't do anything, so I removed it. 
Just use the 'jar' target and then run the bat script. 
It should be enough to see how things work.

The clados.jar file is expected in the lib directory of the project. You can 
see this by looking at the single shell command in the bat file. The actual
calculator is within the jar file target and the manifest file takes care of 
ensuring java -jar knows what to do.

I changed what gets included in the clados calculator jar to include the
contents of the clados jar for now. That means the calculator can be run as
a self-contained jar app. I see no reason to change this in the near future
since the primary purpose of this calculator is to debug the clados library.

Making this work yourself is just a matter of including clados.jar in the 
lib directory of the project. The jar target will pull its parts into the 
calculator jar.

I changed what gets included in the clados calculator jar again to AVOID
the contents of the clados jar. What that really means is I finally figured
out how to use clados.jar as an external library. Yah. A basic skill I 
should have learned years ago. Better late than never.

I also moved most of the image properties out of the properties file and 
embedded them as required resources in the code. That means if anyone messes
with file names in the icons directory, the code won't compile as is. They
will also have to fix the strings that call out to those resources. A few
are left in, though. Specifically the ones having to do with clados resources.
Things like icons for Foot, Cardinal, Algebra, etc.

Finally, the manifest buried in the jar has the classpath to use the clados.jar
library if one puts it in lib. If you want it elsewhere, write your own 
command line to the calculator's jar and insert your own classpath variation.
