I created an 'install' target within the ANT buildfile.  At the moment it
creates jar files for clados and the API documentation and places them in the 
top directory for the project.

The clados.jar file is a library that may be placed where java libraries are
stored on your system.  Be sure to include it in your classpath statement to
ensure other applications know where to find it's contents.
