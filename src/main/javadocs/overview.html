<h1>Clifford Algebra Multivector Calculator</h1>
<h2>Utility for viewing and calculating with clados</h2>


<h2>Background</h2>
Clifford Algebras were invented by William Kingdon Clifford in 1878 as part of his attempt
to represent geometry in an algebraic manner.  The biquaternions are an example of such an
algebra and are immediately useful as a space-time algebra.  Clifford Algebras might have
been in use today in place of the current Gibbs derived systems if Clifford's proponents
had better understood his work.  Clifford died shortly afterwards in 1879.
<br>
Clifford Algebras are a compact, efficient way of representing geometry in an encapsulated
way.  Clifford algebras capture most of the physical needs for vectors, matricies, and
higher order tensors in physical applications.  The clados package implements Clifford
Algebras of at least one generator in a manner that actively blocks many of the simpler
programmatic errors an applicaton developer can make while creating physical simulations.
<br>
The word 'Clados' is an acronym for CLifford Algebra Derived ObjectS.  This acronym was
chosen largely to avoid name collisions with other JAVA math packages.  The Monad class
within Clados implements a single algebra object.  Most people familiar with Clifford
Algebras are more familiar with the term 'Multivector' over 'Monad'.  Again, in the
interests of avoiding name collisions with the other JAVA packages and their classes,
the term 'Monad' will be used and may be treated as a synonym for 'Multivector.'  This
choice does leave an unplanned benefit for future advancements within Clados.  Two algebra
objects will be implemented in classes named Dyad and Dyadic.  Higher order objects will
follow this naming convention.
<h2>Academic Style</h2>
The subject of Clifford Algebra and Clifford Analysis is well developed within Mathematics.
The use of these algebras in Physics is generally more primitive.  The implementation of
Clifford Algebras within Clados is done in the 'physicist' style.  This means the
implementation is a little sloppy compared to its Mathematical roots.  The author recognizes
that Clados needs a fair amount of work to improve its pedigree, but is satisfied for now
with a package that works.
