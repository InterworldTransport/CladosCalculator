	Clados API Documentation

API Documentation can be generated much like a compiled version
of Clados can be generated.

From the top of a working copy of the repository, do the 
following:

	ant javadoc
	
	or 
	
	ant jar_API_docs

This command will fill a directory alongside the Clados
directory called doc/api.  Within the api directory can be found the
output of javadoc as applied to the com.interworldtransport
trees.

The first Ant target will create all the html files from javadoc.
The second Ant target will run the first one and then jar all the 
html generated.
